This library is for parsing and composing Microsoft DirectDraw Surface files.
These files hold texture data for DirectX.  Other drawing APIs also can use
this texture data such as OpenGL and Vulkan.

This library does not attempt to manipulate the texture data contained within
the file, of which there are many kinds.
